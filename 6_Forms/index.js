// TODO: Add a keyup listener on the first input field, so that once you type a letter in this field, it goes into the <span id="display-firstname">. The content of the field and the span should always remain the same.
// TODO: Add a keyup listener on the second input (the number input), so that if the age is below 18 the content of the section a-hard-truth remains hidden, otherwise show them this hard to swallow fact.
// TODO: Add a keyup listener on both fields and show a visual hint (for instance turn the field red) if the password is too short (less than 6 characters) or if the password and its confirmation do not match.
// TODO: Finally, use a change listener on the <select> field to toggle a dark mode on the whole page. For ease of use, we'll say that the dark mode is just turning the background black and the text white.
